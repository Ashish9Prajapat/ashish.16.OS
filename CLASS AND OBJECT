//program in C++ that demonstrates the creation and usage of a class and objects:(~0827CY221016)


#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Define a class called Student
class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int age;
    double gpa;

public:
    // Constructor
    Student(string name, int age, double gpa) {
        this->name = name;
        this->age = age;
        this->gpa = gpa;
    }

    // Member functions
    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << ", GPA: " << gpa << endl;
    }

    double getGPA() {
        return gpa;
    }

    void setGPA(double newGPA) {
        gpa = newGPA;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create an object of the Student class
    Student student1("John Doe", 20, 3.8);

    // Call member functions
    student1.displayInfo();
    cout << "John's current GPA: " << student1.getGPA() << endl;

    // Update the GPA
    student1.setGPA(4.0);
    cout << "John's updated GPA: " << student1.getGPA() << endl;

    // Create another object of the Student class
    Student student2("Jane Smith", 22, 3.5);

    // Call member function for the second object
    student2.displayInfo();

    return 0;
}


Output:

Name: John Doe, Age: 20, GPA: 3.8
John's current GPA: 3.8
John's updated GPA: 4
Name: Jane Smith, Age: 22, GPA: 3.5


This program demonstrates how to define a class with member variables and member functions, create objects of that class, and use the member functions to access and modify
the object's data. Each object has its own set of member variables, and the member functions can operate on those variables for the specific object.
